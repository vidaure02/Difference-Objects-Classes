Difference Between Objects and Classes

Class is a detailed description, the definition, and the template of what an object will be. But it is not the object itself. It is a container for one or more related functions, and a user-defined data type, that holds its own data members and member functions, which can be accessed and used by creating an instance of that class. It is the blueprint of any object. Once we have written a class and defined it, we can use it to create as many objects based on that class as we want. For example, a Car class would define what properties a car has and what it can do, but no actual car is represented until an object of the Car class is created.

Object is an instance of a class. All data members and member functions of the class can be accessed with the help of objects. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated, but memory is allocated when it is instantiated or an object is created. For example, an object of a Car class might have attributes such as color, make, and model, and behaviors like start(), accelerate(), and brake(). Each object can have its own unique state, meaning that multiple objects of the same class can exist with different attribute values.

Conceptual Differences:

Blueprint vs. Instance: A class is a blueprint or template, while an object is an instance of that blueprint.

Memory Allocation: Classes do not occupy memory until objects are created. Each object created from a class will have its own set of instance variables, occupying memory independently.

Manipulation: Classes cannot be manipulated directly as they do not exist in memory, whereas objects can be manipulated.

Value Containment: Classes do not contain actual values associated with the fields, but each object has its own values that are associated with it.
